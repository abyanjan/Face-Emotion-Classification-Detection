# Face-Emotion-Classification-Detection

Performing Face emotion classification on [FER-13 data](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) on Kaggle with Tensorflow.

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces.
The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories 
(0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)
